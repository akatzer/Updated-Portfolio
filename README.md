# Updated-Portfolio-October-Revision

I have updated the application to include some additional functionality.
-   More mobile responsive.
-   The portfolio tab is now dynamically generated using firebase and javascript.
    - new-project.html is included in the repo and is a stand alone app that is used to upload the project information into firebase.
-   The contact me page now actually sends inputed data to a firebase directory.
-   LinkedIn, GitHub, and email-me links included with font awesome icons in the footer.
-   Portfolio projects all have a picture, project title, link to the deployed page, and a link to the repo.
