            <p>I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and after a few moves in my early years my family and I landed in Olathe, KS.
                I was in first grade at the time and we have been in the Kansas City area ever since.</p>
            <p>I attended high school at Olathe South, graduating in 2005 and began my college career at Johnson
                County Community College. I attended school there for two years while working full time. After my time
                at JCCC was up it was off to Kansas State where I graduated in December 2009 with a degree in Business
                Administration with an emphasis in Human Resources.</p>
            <p>I moved back to Olathe after graduation and have worked for AMC Theatres, Farmers Insurance, and my
                current employer, <a id="work-link" href="https://kansascity.swagelok.com"
                    target="_blank">Swagelok Kansas City, </a>where I have now worked for over 7 years.</p>
            <p>My wife Kristen and I were married on September 14th, 2013 (we were highschool sweethearts). Our first
                child Hunter was born on September 24th, 2016 and baby Katzer #2 is due on November 29th of this year!
                I also have a dog named Dexter and he is a Pug/Beagle mix.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not working, in class, or working on classwork I can be found spending time with my family, hanging out in the mancave either playing video games or watching tv,
                doing yard work, or doing various projects around the house.</p>
